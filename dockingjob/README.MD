This folder is used for the docking
Docking will be performed between the NSP13 .pdbqt file and the ZINC.pdbqt file present in this folder.
While calling run_docking_on_ligands, the function will automatically, for each ligand, delete the previous ligands file, and replace it with the new ligand
All docking outputs are saved in the folder docking_output
